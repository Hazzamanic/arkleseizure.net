This is just a quick post to announce a new free extension for Visual Studio. It is for Orchard developers and aims to basically generate a bunch of Orchard specific template code for you. It is available on the [Visual Studio Gallery][1], and the source code is up on [GitHub][2]. List of up-to-date (potentially anyway) features can be found [here][3]. Go get it!

I'm hoping to add new features every now and again, usually as and when I need them but if you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.
