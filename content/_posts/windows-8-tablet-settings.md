<p>This has been one of my few complaints with Windows 8, which unlike seemingly everyone else on the planet, I have quiet enjoyed. Windows 8 has this annoying habit of changing my Tablet settings, even though I am working on a desktop. You would think this wouldn&#39;t be an issue, except that any sort of drop down menu in programs will drop down the wrong way. It is weird and makes me sad inside. After hunting around a little bit on the internet I came across the solution.</p>

<p>Press ctrl + q (to access the search) and type &quot;Tablet PC Settings&quot;. This should bring up a little window with two tabs. Select Other and change the &quot;Handedness&quot; (awesome name, right?) setting to left-handed and all should be good.</p>

<p>I have yet to work out the cause of the random changes I keep getting subjected to as it appears to be utterly random. I have reported the issue to Microsoft but they are probably inundated with Windows 8 related complaints that my voice is unlikely to be heard. Ah well</p>
