<p>I sometimes find myself in the situation where I want to have the command prompt open from where I currently am in the file explorer. Usually I have always just opened the command prompt and navigated there using a command. I was just looking through my downloads the other day when I spazzed out and right clicked with the shift key down and noticed that it had added the option to &quot;Open command window here&quot;. This is an cool little feature that I reckon could come in&nbsp; quite handy in the future.</p>
