I recently got sent several emails full of a bazillion images that I had to upload to a website. Okay so there weren't that many, but close to a thousand images. Now, unfortunately, instead of attaching the images, or using something like WeTransfer, these images were all inserted inline. And Gmail offers no way to download all these images. Super lame. And I was not going to save each image individually. Hell no. Luckily, if you just press Ctrl + S on the email, you can save the webpage, which will download all the pages assets into a folder, including all the pesky inline images! Simples.
