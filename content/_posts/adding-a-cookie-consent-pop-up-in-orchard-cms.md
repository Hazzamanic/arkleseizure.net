This is the simplest of modules for adding a cookie consent pop up to your Orchard CMS website. It uses the [SilkTide JavaScript library][1], which is neat and quite unobtrusive (no taking over the screen or shifting content all over the shop). The module offers a few configuration options available in Settings -> Cookie Consent. It is open source, generously donated to the world by [Media On Demand Streaming Ltd][2] and lazily maintained by me. You can grab it [here][3].

I've finally put together a better workflow for managing my open source modules so hoping to share a few more bits I use day to day. Is that something to look forward to? I'm really not sure.
